[README](https://git.nmlv.nml.com/ULL4155/sandbox-ansible/tree/master/vagrant_kubernetes_node)
The purpose of this repository is to maintain the automation of adding and removing a Kubernetes node to an existing Kubernetes cluster.  This facilitates the ability to simply scale up and down your virtual hardware that supports a Kubernetes test environment.  Instructions are provided in the README file to manually setup your environment at which point you'll be able to manage it using the included Ansible Playbooks.
